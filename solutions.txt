Because I'm lazy I won't provided solutions in code, I'll just describe them.
  (Sorry)

1.1:
  The loop is going from 0 up to array.length _inclusive_. But, there is no
  element at array[array.length], so we get an exception.

  Fix: Change <= to <

2.1:
  Correcness Bugs:
    More off-by-one errors -- i and j go up to max but don't include it.

2.2:
  Crashing Bug:
    i=i++ does not actually increment i. If you're interested in why, I'll provide an
    explanation -- but the gist is you should be careful about using 'i++' any
    more than by itself. Options you can use:
      i++;
      i += 1;
      i = i+1;

    Why i = i++ doesn't work:
      i++ is a post-increment. This means that java returns the current value,
      and then increments i. So, when you say
        i = i++;
      you're setting i to its own value, and the increment never happens.
      This is completely non-obvious, and it's all Java's fault. )':

  Correctness Bug:
    The format string is "%3o" instead of "%3d". That prints the octal
    representation of the number, not the decimal representation. I suppose this
    isn't really a correctness bug, but it's not what we usually expect to see.
